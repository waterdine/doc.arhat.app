Arhat&trade; prototypes games using Visual Novels.
Arhat&trade; is suitable for creating stories between friends, or as a way to design stories for larger games.
Arhat&trade; provides a simple Visual Novel script and project format, that can be shared.

### Arhat&trade; script
This is the scripting format for Visual Novels

The 虎.engine is split into 3 frameworks.

Arhat currently uses a simple per scene script format.
Our plan is to update to use a screenwriting format similar to http://fountain.io.
